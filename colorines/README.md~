Steps to compile the project:

In colorines file:

javac colores/dibujador.java colores/frame.java colores/colisiones.java colores/cuadro.java colores/brocha.java colores/caida.java

To execute the game:

java colores/frame

It seems to be some problems in the detection of colisions between the line the player paints, and the squares. Trying to fix it out.
