Steps to compile the project:

In colorines file:

javac tunel/dibujador.java tunel/fondo.java tunel/jugador.java tunel/pantalla.java tunel/salido.java

To execute the game:

java tunel/pantalla

It seems to be some problems in the detection of colisions between the line the player paints, and the falling squares. Trying to fix it out.
